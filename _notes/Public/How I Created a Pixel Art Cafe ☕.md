### Concept

The idea for this cafe came from a short instrumental track I wrote:
{% include AudioEmbed.html src="/assets/audio/ok.wav" %}
After hearing it, a friend pointed out that it sounded like an upscale restaurant or cafe, so I decided to create an image to complement the music.

### Reference Images

My first idea was to have a girl sitting by a window, looking out at the street from inside a cafe. For reference, I immediately thought of the lofi hip-hop girl, but I also looked for images that had a good contrast between warm and cold tones to create a sense of coziness.

### Process

#### 1. Blocking

To start, I decide on a composition, block out shapes, and define the boundary between the warm interior and cold exterior.

#### 2. Window

I immediately scrap the idea of illustrating a street so that I can keep the focus on the inside rather than the outside. I decide to only include the silhouettes of pedestrians on the sidewalk, which I think lends a bit of atmosphere and gives the girl something to look at.

#### 3. Wall Detailing

Next comes detailing for the wall, window, and door. This is an overpriced hipster coffee shop, so exposed brick is a must.

#### 4. The Girl

I define the girl’s features and give her a cup of coffee to warm her hands.

#### 5. Chairs

Then I give the chairs some more character and depth.

#### 6. Light Construction

Here, I draw lines to figure out how the light should enter the room, keeping it simple with right triangles.

#### 7. Light & Shadow

Using the guidelines, I block in the light and then add back shadows where they belong. The tables and chairs don’t technically cast an accurate 45-degree shadow, but I choose to keep the contours of the shadows clean and recognizable.

I also take this opportunity to add drawers and plants to the back. This should probably be a separate step, but I already went ahead and did it.

#### 8. Countertop & Shadow Detailing

I start working on a wood countertop to complement the forest-y theme, complete with an iPad register and a tipping machine. This is 2022 after all.

I also go back and add imperfections to the shadows on the floor to reflect the snow and frost on the window.

#### 9. Light shafts (Final Result)

Using the light guidelines from earlier, I add some subtle light shafts. Here is the final result:

### Final Thoughts

This took the better part of a day to complete, and as someone who is not too experienced with perspective drawing (I nearly gave up in the [blocking step](#1-blocking)), this has been my most challenging pixel creation so far. That said, this turned out better than I thought it would, and I’m quite happy with the result.
