### Concept

[[test]]
I think my original intention was to create a closeup of the face, but I naturally gravitated towards the eye. I wanted to tell some sort of story, so the extreme closeup gave me a nice canvas to play around with. For the sea/underwater aspect, I was inspired by the episode “Fish Night” from the Netflix series *Love, Death & Robots*. There is a gorgeous scene at the end where a man is immersed in an invisible ocean, surrounded by glowing schools of fish.
