### Concept

The inspiration for this piece was this short track that I wrote:

{% include AudioEmbed.html src="/assets/audio/ok.wav" %}

After hearing it, a friend pointed out that it sounded like an upscale restaurant or cafe, so that became my starting point.

### Reference Images

I wanted the scene to be a girl looking out the window at the street from inside a cafe and I instantly thought of the lofi hiphop girl when thinking of references. I also looked for images that have a good contrast between cold and warm to create a sense of coziness.

### Process

#### 1. Blocking

Here, I decided on a composition, block out shapes, and establish the contrast between the warm interior and cold exterior.

#### 2. Window

I scrapped the idea of illustrating a street in order to draw focus to the interior rather than the exterior. Instead, I show only the silhouettes of pedestrians on the sidewalk. I think it intensifies the coldness outside, creates a sense of mystery, and gives something for the girl to look at.

#### 3. Wall Detailing

Detailed the wall, window, and door. I like exposed brick.

#### 4. The Girl

Defined the girl’s features and gave her a cup of coffee to warm her hands.

#### 5. Chairs

Gave the furniture some character and depth.

#### 6. Light Construction

Drew some lines to figure out how the light should enter the room. I keep it simple with right triangles.

#### 7. Light & Shadow

Used the guidelines to block in the light rectangles and then added back shadows where appropriate. The tables and chairs do not cast an accurate 45-degree shadow, but I chose to keep them simple and recognizable.

I also took the opportunity to add drawers and plants to the back. This probably should have been a separate step, but oh well…

#### 8. Countertop & Shadow Detailing

Here, I added a wood countertop to complement the forest-y theme, as well as an iPad register. This is 2022 after all.

I also added some imperfection to the shadows on the floor to reflect the snow and frost on the window.

#### 9. Light shafts (Final Result)

Using the light guidelines from earlier, I added some subtle light shafts. Here is the final result:

### Final Thoughts

This took the better part of a day to complete, and as someone who is not too experienced with perspective drawing (I nearly gave up in the [blocking step](#1-blocking), this has been my most challenging pixel creation so far. That said, I’m quite happy with the final result.
