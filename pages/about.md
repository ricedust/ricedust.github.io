Hello,

My name is Shane and I work under the handle **RICEDUST**. I'm a Software Engineering major pursuing a minor in Math as well as Digital Media Arts. 

I am a growing developer, artist, and musician who is interested in games as a medium for storytelling. I am always looking for ways to improve my craft and opportunities to architect compelling experiences.

I made this website to share my work and document my journey. Thanks for visiting.
